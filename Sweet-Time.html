I wanted to write a log summarising my 2024! It’s already almost February but I figured I should write while I have the chance, since I’m on a short break.
<br>
I’m not sure if I had ever been as depressed or borderline suicidal as I was in Sept–Nov 2023, and I decided to seek professional help in January 2024. I have always been very adverse towards and skeptical of therapy, it was really a last resort sort of thing. Unfortunately, my experience has only confirmed my beliefs that therapy would never work for me. In fact, I’d go so far to say it made it even worse temporarily, because I had to dredge up all the horrible, repressed memories that should’ve stayed repressed and never thought about again. I genuinely believe this – that forgetting is the only remedy to suffering.
<br>
<br>
You can’t undo what’s been done to you, or what you’ve had the misfortune of experiencing. I really think I would’ve spiralled if I had continued therapy, because I can’t bear to remember. Worst of all, now there is someone out there who has seen my face, seen me cry (ugh….) and has had to witness my trauma dumping all in the span of the first 2 hours of meeting me. She seemed speechless, which only made me feel even worse. But it’s alright, because I know I can count on her to forget. I count on the 2 other people I’ve trusted enough to tell some of my past to forget too. At least one of them definitely has forgotten by now. It brings me so much comfort, the idea of being forgotten… I wonder, why does anyone want to be remembered? 
<br>
<br>
My memory has never been particularly amazing, but I remember many, many moments from my childhood, in detail, since my earliest memory from 2/3 years old. I heard of people completely blanking out traumatic memories, and I was always so envious of them. Those memories have not gotten a single bit hazier with the years gone by. Of course, I have a couple happy moments that I remember in great detail too. But they’re very brief, lasting about 3 seconds or less each.

But then, in April, I went to the sea by myself and sat on the rocks. It’s where I realised how beautiful trees were, for the first time…

￼

In the same month, I went to go see the flowers. It was such a tiring adventure, I really thought I wouldn’t make it at some point, but when I finally made it there it all seemed worth it. I can still feel the cold breeze and hear the noise of the waterfall looking at the images. It’s interesting how simple experiences like that can etch into your mind so permanently.

￼

Skipping ahead to November, I attended the concert of one of my longtime favourite artists! I really dislike crowds and screaming, so I’m really picky with what events I choose to go to. This was my first ever concert! I cried a LOT, even to songs I have never cried to before, just 15 minutes into the show, because I was so overwhelmed with emotion. And when it came to the songs I actually cry to just listening on my own… well…. let’s just say I’m glad I wasn’t in the first row. I know everybody says it, but it’s really surreal, looking at someone you’ve only seen through a screen, in real life. Like wow, he exists!? And he made this music that had a real, huge impact on me. I was only a few rows away from the stage, but none of my pictures or videos came out clearly because of the darkness. But I could see him quite clearly with my own eyes. 
I don’t think you can see the audience super clearly from the stage because of all the lights, but I feel like he made eye contact at one point and smiled comfortingly while I was crying really hard. It doesn’t help that I was definitely the only person close to the stage bawling my eyes out… But I am probably being delusional. 😸 
</p>

I still cry watching the videos back, I think this was the one moment where I truly felt grateful to be alive. And every time I rewatch the videos I took I feel that same sentiment again. Isn’t it crazy how someone could possess so much talent, brilliance, and most importantly love, that it materialises into real hope to someone?
<br>
<br>
Towards New Years’ Eve, I got a bunch of casual, nice interactions with strangers that made me feel happy. In a way, 2024 was one of the better years in my life thus far! It will be hard for 2025 to top it, but I’ll try my best. I am wishing you the best too. Thank you for reading.
