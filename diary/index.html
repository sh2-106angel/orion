          Pumpkin purrs really loudly. I was sitting on the curb and tried to get him to come up on my lap—top. My laptop was resting on top of my lap), and as soon as he rested one paw on it I felt like a bowling ball was on me, and my laptop started to wobble out of place. I guess Pumpkin can’t be a lap cat… <br><br>

The calico kitty sneezed in my face then slow blinked as if to apologise. I had to wipe my eyes…

          Today I saw a strange man, who looked like he was waiting for someone, standing outside my building. After he saw me, he began walking to the lift and we entered the lift together. I think I saw a man like him before on another day, who looked like he was waiting for someone as well, but on that day there was a lady who entered the lift with me, and he did not follow.<br><br>

          I didn’t wear my lucky ear cuff today. <br><br>
          
          Nothing really fazes me these days. </p>
        <p>8.10.25<br><br>
          I bought some origami paper with Claude Monet’s paintings on them, and went to the pet store to buy some cat treats. I recognised another cashier who also has a warm smile.

          Today I saw the cashier with the warm smile again. </p>

          School is getting pretty busy with all these group projects. I’ve been really bummed out because recently I came to the realisation that I’d have to delay my graduation because I forgot to take a class that is only offered in the Fall semester, but maybe it’s a good thing because I don’t think I could handle 4 group projects at the same time. I haven’t touched the book I was reading in a long while.<br><br>

          This time next year, I really really <b>really</b> hope I’ll be abroad, my main motivation for being enrolled in the first place. I hope I’ll see many beautiful things; like a bird out of a cage, I want to be free. It has been my singular dream growing up to “escape” this place. Even though it will only be for a semester, I want to spend it happily away by myself. So please… let me have this one thing. </p>

        <p>30.9.25<br><br>
          Today I saw the woman with the Shiba Inu dog at the bus stop again! He ran up the stairs too fast for her to keep up.<br><br>

          These couple of days are going to be hectic because of school, but I think I’m handling it okay.<br><br>
          
          While I was petting a really emaciated black cat, a woman came up to me and asked me if I wanted to adopt her…. pet mouse? I promptly declined, politely, and thought it was a little strange. This reminded me of an unsettling interaction with a creepy old man a few years back, although I know that this woman probably didn’t mean anything much by it. I do really dislike unnecessary interactions with strangers still though. <br><br>
          
          I found a new Siamese kitten in my neighbourhood that looks like a stray but could be someone’s lost pet..? It was really scared but curious at the same time, and had no collar. <br><br>
          
          Pumpkin is so friendly now and he’s also at his usual spots way more consistently. I think he’s waiting for me! He rubbed his face against my laptop, marking his territory. I guess it’s his now, so can he do my assignments? </p>
        <p>29.9.25<br><br>
          Today, we had a quiz in class. I arrived to class only to realise my laptop’s battery was dead because it was not charging overnight. Even though I managed to borrow a charger, unfortunately, it didn’t work. <br><br>

          I’m already feeling the effects of losing my lucky ear cuff. </p>
        <p>28.9.25<br><br>
          I think I can vaguely recall when my birthday last fell on a Sunday.<br><br>

Today I celebrated by giving all the neighbourhood kitties treats! <br><br>

And went to an orchestra concert for the very first time. It was the Stardew Valley’s Symphony of Seasons concert. I even shed a tear (unsurprisingly) during Cloth, my favourite soundtrack of the game. Orchestra music always makes me cry, because it is just so beautiful, I can feel the music in my bones, and though really good music from other genres can make me feel the same way too, nothing moves me quite like the sound of strings. <br><br>

I wanted to get the music box, but it was sadly sold out. I could only queue for the merch after the show because I was almost late for the show and the queue during intermission was too long that I wasn’t allowed to join…<br><br>

The only thing I managed to get was a blue chicken keychain. <br><br>

I went to visit Pumpkin after the concert ended, and saw a couple seemingly trying to find him. But, he only came out when he saw me! Now he’s no longer mean and accepts pets anywhere. And of course, he always belly flops against my foot and pushes me against his.. weight. <br><br>

Just as I told him I had to leave and moved to grab my bag, he immediately jumped up the ledge right next to me, and even tried flopping again to stop me from leaving. It has to be the hardest thing to leave a cat. I’m sorry…<br><br>

It was a good day. It even rained for a while, the rain brings back my happiest memories.

        </p>
        <p>25.9.25<br><br>
          Today I dropped one of my lucky ear cuffs while crossing the street. <br><br>

Two beautiful butterflies surrounded me for a moment at the bus stop. They were black, with orange and blue at the edge of their wings. Perhaps male <i>lexis dirtea merguia</i>… but I have no idea. <br><br>

I came home to realise I had matcha on my forehead, possibly all throughout class. 
        </p>
        <p>23.9.25<br><br>
          I finally saw Teddy again! I was petting him, when suddenly Pumpkin came around the corner, and Teddy immediately started picking a fight with him. Poor Pumpkin was so scared. Teddy is genuinely a menace to every cat in the neighbourhood, except the old senior ginger cat who's emaciated. I guess even cats have morals.
        </p>
        <p>22.9.25<br><br>
          I did my presentation today. Yay… for now, because there are more at the end of the semester. While speaking, I can feel my face growing warmer and warmer, and I trip up on words more easily. It’s hell. I could never get used to this, no matter how many times I do it. 

        </p>
        <p>21.9.25<br><br>
          Saw Pumpkin again. Our usual routine is he comes to me, meowing, I give him head pats and then treats, he meows for more, to which I refuse, and he goes to sleep, purring. 
        </p>
        <p>20.9.25<br><br>
          A 5 hour group project meeting today. I mixed up the names of the two guys in the group, and it was devastatingly embarrassing. <br><br>

          I have a presentation on Monday that we still haven’t decided who’s speaking for which part and I’m starting to get anxious. If I don’t practise my part by myself, I’ll end up stuttering when we actually do it.. and most times I stutter anyway, but it’s less… severe! <br><br>
          
          I saw Pumpkin tonight. He accepted some head pats then went to sleep and got upset if I tried to pet him again. That’s fair… I wouldn’t want to be pet while sleeping either. Something I’ve always liked about cats was that they sort of make you respect them. I always found that really cool…</p>
        <p>19.9.25<br><br>
          I was awoken by an argument happening outside my door. <br><br>

          I stayed in bed all day today, fatigued by everything.</p>
        <p>18.9.25<br><br>
          Today, after I left the house, I found a dead butterfly on the pavement. Initially I thought it was still alive since it seemed to be moving. I tried flipping it over a little, but then I realised that it was the wind that was moving it. Google says it was a Lime Butterfly. Its beautiful carcass was a few steps away from the tortoiseshell kitty, so I think we have our culprit… Admittedly, besides its wings, it looks pretty creepy. I used to be a bug kid for a while growing up because I had a bug kid friend, and we caught beetles and ants… I remember bringing home a big ant once in the palm of my hand (please, don’t ask me why) and my mother immediately killed it. Not that I’m saying this was traumatic or anything. I really do love beetles still.<br><br> 

          My afternoon class was fun, thanks to my lovely and funny group mates. I really lucked out on them. I got complimented on my hands by one of the girls, which I didn’t really take seriously but I was happy because my hands have always been one of my insecurities. One of my group members drew a cute cat on Figma, that slowly progressed into our professor, but as a cat.. It was really funny, and I realised a cat with a receding hairline would still be really cute. I want to become friends with them so badly… <br><br>
          
          I almost… don’t want this semester to end? I know we’ll become strangers again once it does. We’ll never even see each other again. <br><br>
          
          I spent my night class almost completely on my phone, on Capcut editing a video for the group project of my afternoon class, and reading the group chat. I may be a little lost now, but there’s nothing YouTube tutorials can’t fix! <br><br>
          
          I tried a banana pudding matcha latte today, and it was so good I have decided that I am only going to get this from now on.<br><br>
          
          In the late night, walking back home, I saw Pumpkin!!! He let me pet him on the head and seemed to really enjoy it. I think I’ll only pet him on the head from now on, since some cats (particularly overweight cats) have arthritis so body pets might hurt them. Later on he went to sleep again and started purring really loudly. Most of the cats I meet have silent purrs that you can only become aware of if you feel the vibrations near their throats, so I really love when cats have loud purrs! Sweet Pumpkin… he uses the cement as his pillow. </p>
        <p>17.9.25<br><br>
          The only downside of being a regular at a place is that they think you order the same thing 100% of the time…. today I decided to try the banana pudding matcha, but they made me my usual order of just a normal matcha instead… of course, I just took the wrong order and left... <br><br>

          The orange kitty seems to be in much better shape these days, he has the energy to meow sometimes and make biscuits! He even purrs louder now. I keep calling him Mr. Fluffy because his fur quality is also much better now, and although I still think he should gain more weight, he is… fluffier. Garfield just wouldn’t be a right fit for him since he doesn’t really have his personality. </p>
        <p>16.9.25<br><br>
          I’m going to be more than an hour late to my group project meeting because I woke up late. I just don’t understand why they keep having the meetings in the morning… <br><br>

          On the way there I realised I forgot my laptop and went back, I met an old lady in the lift who also forgot to bring something! We laughed about it a little. This simple interaction oddly made me feel happy. <br><br>
          
          It’s a pretty hot day today, and even though my face is all swollen from eating a sandwich yesterday, I still reluctantly make my way out. <br><br>
          
          I was sitting at the back of the bus and I just knocked my head while getting up in front of the two people I was sitting beside and it was pretty loud. I think they laughed at me…🫩 I don’t know if it’s because I’ve hit my head on the bus so many times by now, but it doesn’t really hurt… <br><br>
          
          I finished that Mishima book and while it was somewhat entertaining, I… was not impressed. I plan on giving <i>Confessions of a Mask</i>, his most popular book, a chance someday. Now, I’m starting <i>Sula</i> by Toni Morrison.<br><br>
          
          Going to the cafe again to do the tons of work I have been procrastinating now, and I did a weird shuffle thing with a guy who was trying to go the opposite of the way I was, it lasted like a few seconds and was so painful I involuntarily cringed.. he ended up boarding the bus too.<br><br>
          
          I ended up not doing much work, sorry… it’s just too early for my brain to function (1pm) <br><br>
          
          I went home around 3pm, and I met the tabby kitty (who I decided to name Teddy!) He is really affectionate and talkative, he likes to tell me about his day… I find myself missing him a lot if I don’t see him for even a day. Teddy was a cat that took some time to get close to. A cat not instantly being friendly is pretty rare for me, I think it took us meeting around 3 times before he suddenly started being really friendly! He’s just scared of people I think, and who can blame him? <br><br>
          
          I always find myself favouring the cats that take some time to warm up to, because our bond feels more “real” that way. I’m the same way with people. <br><br>
          
          I found Pumpkin too and we exchanged a few slow blinks, he was sleeping on top of a car trunk! <br><br>
          
          Then I took a 5 hour nap… zzz</p>
        <p>15.9.25<br><br>
          Discussions about moving again are being made. I listen, as I always have, since I do not have a say. I dread the day it happens. There are a total of 13 cat friends that I’ve made in this neighbourhood, some of them I’ve known for several years. I can’t bear to leave them…</p>
        <p>14.9.25<br><br>
          A near 5 hour group project meeting in a non-air conditioned room (because it’s a Sunday and the school shuts it off) has me feeling pretty drained. It’s not like I have anything else planned, but I’d still like to have my days off for myself.<br><br>

          However, everyone is so lovely that I cannot complain as much as I want to, and I know by now not to take lovely people for granted. <br><br>
          
          One girl brought her Tamagotchi, and although I’ve never had one, I have the strongest urge to befriend her. But, well, friendships are hard in college, and the more you try to force things, the further you’re pushed away, like swimming in a high tide lonely sea… 
           I also found out that I have a group project presentation next week that my group has done absolutely nothing for, so that’s… </p>
        <p>13.9.25<br><br>
          While feeding the overweight kitty, I think I decided on “Pumpkin” as his name, he kept meowing at me for more… too bad! <br><br>

He always comes up to me really close now, but I’m always hesitant to pet him because he might swat at me. It almost looked like he wanted a hug as he came super close to my face, but I value my life… then he tried to yell at me to stop me from leaving.<br><br>

A man on a bicycle with his kid in front of him thanked me for giving him way. I wasn’t expecting a thanks for a simple step to the side… <br><br>

Did some studying at the cafe even though I didn’t really want to leave the house.<br><br>

And now I can’t move, because Pumpkin is sleeping without a care in the world, with his whole belly out (he thinks I’m guarding him), with one leg resting on my foot. <br><br>

He scooted closer… and is sleeping deeply now. He touches me of his own accord now, and I’m so happy. I’ve never bonded with a cat by food motivation before, so I still don’t completely trust him (to not get mad at me), but I’ll continue to try my best… 
        </p>
        <p>12.9.25<br><br>
          We went to the park, and we were sitting on a bench when this strange elderly lady came up and sat on the bench opposite us. We didn’t think anything of it, even when she was seemingly falling asleep while a reel was playing on her phone on loud. She was just acting… peculiar. <br><br>

And then… a SNAKE appeared out of nowhere, right beside her! I was… only slightly rattled (no pun intended), because it was a really beautiful snake. I’ve never seen a snake other than a python in real life before - this one had interesting black and green markings, and was surprisingly flat and narrow. It eventually climbed up the brick wall, to the roof of the pavilion. It was very calm. Perhaps it just wanted to say hi! <br><br>

I maintained my distance, but then I had to quiet suppress my laughter because that lady started <i>chanting prayers</i> towards the snake. My brain was still trying to make sense of it all. Another day, another weird encounter, but what of it? It keeps life interesting. <br><br>

Then we made our way to the aquarium. The aquarium is one of my favourite places, its beauty is not merely about the visual spectacle (because beauty is always more than what meets the eye.) In places like that, you get to witness so, so much love. Young couples, elderly couples, families, little kids (the ones that aren’t crying, anyway)… The happiness just radiates off of them. I’m sure you understand what I mean. There is nothing more beautiful than love; I find myself wondering while I gaze, have I felt this intensity of love that measures up to what I’ve witnessed? If the answer is yes, I’ll be content, but if the answer is no, I’ll simply continue to love, because perhaps that is my limit!  <br><br>

<s>Speaking of witnessing the joy of strangers, Christmas time is approaching once again. My favourite time of the year! </s> <br><br>

In some of the candid photos taken of me, there is a couple looking up at the wondrous sting ray swimming above their heads in the glass dome. Perhaps some will be annoyed by this, but I find it so lovely whenever strangers are in the backgrounds of my photographs, I can’t help but find it so incredibly moving that their lives and stories have been captured in an image like that. You may not get the full story, but it is nice to know that for a brief moment in time I have proof of the fact that they existed in my world. You probably have been in the background of someone else’s photographs too! <b>A life is always worth documenting. </b> <br><br>
<img style="width:50%; margin:auto;" src="sep/20250912_174619.avif"><br><br>
<img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="sep/IMG_1100.avif"><br><br>
<img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="sep/IMG_1102.avif"><br><br>

A bunch of ‘Wooow’s and ‘I caught that in Stardew Valley!’s later, we came to the end of the aquarium trip. <br><br>

I don’t have much else to say besides… I’m content.
        </p>
        <p>11.9.25<br><br>
          People watching out the bus window, I see 3 girls underneath one umbrella, laughing. A memory from when I was the happiest I’d ever been in my life crosses my mind, because like today, it was a rainy day. Raining so heavily. I still don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard before as I did then. Stumbling here and there, struggling to stay underneath the umbrella. Sharing the umbrella with someone whom I loved more than anything in the world. Surely, nothing else will ever, ever rival that magical feeling. <br><br>

Now I am walking, and I see 2 ladies, one of them clasping the hand of a little girl, all of them wearing the same matching outfit. A floral dress and a cardigan. <br><br>

Then, a very kind woman shielded me under her umbrella at the traffic light crossing. Though I was already drenched by then, I appreciated it so much. I was late to a group project meeting and I arrived with my long hair dripping with water. <br><br>

My project group mates turned out to be lovely people! <br><br>

While leaving, a kind guy helped me buzz the door open from the other side so I didn’t have to get my student card out, he did it so nonchalantly as he walked past that I was confused for a short moment. Is this what they call aura…?<br><br>

So much kindness was shown to me today! <br><br>

I’m now going back home to dry my hair and eat.<br><br>

<b>…</b> <br><br>

Off I go again to class, entering mathematical functions into Microsoft Excel, god… <br><br>

Another day completed. I look forward to meeting a dear friend tomorrow. Sometimes I think that that’s really all I need in this trivial life. To see them, and know that they are doing okay. <br><br>
The people that ‘fate’ led me to, the people I chose, and who chose me back, have always made me the happiest. So that I can continue living until I can’t anymore. I hope you are well too, because in all of our trivialities, we are one and the same. 

        </p>
  
        <p>10.9.25<br><br>
          Today is the day the overweight cat showed me his BELLY! Everyone…… please congratulate me, for this is a beautiful blossoming of our relationship. Right now he is sitting so close to me, right behind me, sort of like he’s guarding me.<br><br>

          <img src="sep/belly.avif"><br><br>

          Though, I doubt he’d be able to, since I also just witnessed his extremely pathetic attempt at hunting a rat. It came so close to him, and was right in front of him at one point, but he was so slow that he failed miserably… it was… hard to watch. <br><br>
          
          Or maybe he thinks I’m guarding him, because now he’s asleep. <br><br>
          
          The elderly lady that always feeds him just arrived, and I make my way back home.





        </p>
        <p>9.9.25<br><br>

At the cafe today, while I was doing some studying I was unintentionally eavesdropping on the conversation happening over at the table beside me. It was a man and a woman, ex-schoolmates, reconnecting now as adults. At first, I thought I was listening to a first date, and I couldn’t bear to go on, but it turns out that it wasn’t the case. <br><br>

I continued to listen to them for a while, but their conversation was so devastatingly boring and hard to listen to that I put on my earphones on both sides. Though, this didn’t help at all since they were sitting so close by that I could still hear them. I eventually got annoyed and left. <br><br>

The overweight kitty has such a short fuse. Sometimes he likes pets, and sometimes he hates it. At the very least, he tolerates being close to me. He loafed in front of me and tried to manipulate me, with his cute face, into giving him more treats..! When cats get too overweight they can’t groom themselves and this can be really detrimental to their health, so I’m minding the amount of treats I give him. 






        </p>
        <p>8.9.25<br><br>
          Today I helped take a photo for a family on my school’s campus. I’m not sure why they’d want a photo <i>here</i> of all places, but I happily obliged. They were a beautiful family of 3, and the mother who asked me for the favour was very polite and kind. It just clicked that they were probably celebrating their daughter’s enrolment.





        </p>
        <p>7.9.25<br><br>
          I’ve had a headache for two days in a row now, but I’m forcing myself to get out of the house and do some work.<br><br>

<s>It’s probably because I’ve been ignoring the fact that I’m intolerant to a lot of food, like what my blood test has shown. </s><br><br>

The fresh air doesn’t seem to be helping at all, in fact it seems to be making it worse. Though, the warmest smile I’ve seen in a while from the cashier helps placate me for a short moment. I find comfort in recognising the service workers I see regularly, yet I don’t wish for them to recognise me.<br><br>

My head is killing me, but I have to do my work so I can return to my Stardew Valley farm…! I recently started playing it again. <br><br>

In the metro, I see a couple racing each other with their prams, making their babies laugh…  how wonderful! Their whimsy is beautiful to witness… a joyous family is the best luck anyone could possess. <br><br>

On the way back home, the overweight cat comes over to me, and he lets me pet him without any treats now! Oh… it makes me a little emotional… I noticed that he has a shorter tail than most cats, and that he is <b>very</b> orange. If he was fully orange, “Garfield” would be a perfect name for him. I always wanted a Garfield of my own. He responds when I say, “Kitty!”



        </p>
        <p>4.9.25<br><br>
          Another long day completed. Someone at the bus stop stopped to tell me about a $2 bill on the ground, thinking it was mine. It wasn’t, but maybe I should’ve just picked it up… either way I’ll just take it as a sign of good luck! <br><br>

          I ordered pizza during class so I’ll have it waiting for me at home, and I’m really excited about my reward for completing the week!<br><br>
          
          These days I get scared if I don’t wear my ‘lucky’ ear cuffs before leaving the house, no matter how much of a rush I’m in. This is probably… a bad thing? I’m becoming foolish. <br><br>
          
          While eating the pizza, I randomly thought of a friend that I had when I was 13-16, who knows why. I’ll tell you a bit about her. She devastated me. She was so pitiful, it broke my heart, despite her projection of some of her inward hatred onto me. She was someone who believed that her existence served the sole purpose of being desired, and her biggest fear was growing old, not having once been desired. She was someone whose mind was so polluted by the evil and depravity in this world, a victim in the saddest sense of the word. This pity I remember once feeling for her overpowers any curiosity I may have about how she’s doing now, that I almost want to believe she stopped existing. <br><br>
          
          Girlhood… the word has been discussed quite a bit online these days, many obsess over it, degenerates fetishise it. Despite all the pain that it’s actually filled with. Pain that, is so lurid, it shocks you for a bit, and renders you speechless. I was speechless when she told me those things, not knowing how to even start to convince someone that they are… <i>human</i>, I tried, but I didn’t get anywhere.<br><br>

          Today they gave me a bear lid for my matcha! The round ears stick out, and it looks so adorable that I decided to keep it.<br><br>

On the bus back home, I’m on the second level of a double decker bus, sitting all the way at the back. I’ve never sat in this seat before, mainly because I don’t want to almost fall in front of everyone while trying to get down at my stop (and once I was too slow to get down and completely missed my stop…), but the bus is really full so I am out of options. <br><br>

My sleep is always interrupted these days, I always wake up twice for no reason, even though I am able to fall back asleep. Maybe it is because of my low iron, but right now I feel extremely fatigued and faint, and I rely on my wobbly legs to carry me back home. 
        </p>
        <p>2.9.25<br><br>
          A long day, I’m not usually outside in the morning but I was today because I had to run an errand. I saw many little grey butterflies fluttering about at the bus stop. <br><br>

I finished that book I was reading, it was a simple, sweet book with some interesting mathematics, but nothing special. I’m now reading <i>Life for Sale</i> by Yukio Mishima (past the first three pages, anyway.)<br><br>

I went to the park and saw the black swans! Majestic as always, and they were so adorable with their little puppy cries. One of them even came up to us, even after all its friends had left, it remained… I thought it was displaying aggression when it flapped its wings once, but then it started to preen its feathers for a long time, loafed like a cat and even slept for a while, uncaring. An elderly man was photographing it up close and tried to pet its head, and he was met with a hiss, but otherwise it seemed really docile. <s>I also saw it defecate a little while later into the grass, and realised that the black stuff nearby where we were sitting was swan poop. </s><br><br>
<img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="sep/IMG_0999.avif"><br><br>


I collected some swan feathers 🪶 that were scattered across the grass patch. <br><br>

I ended the day with a visit to the cats, of course. The overweight cat started making biscuits upon seeing me, but he didn’t seem to want pets today (and I didn’t want to risk being swatted at.) It’s okay, because patience is something I happen to have tons of! <br><br>

        Starting the month off with another encounter with a weird stranger. I was walking on campus during my small window of break time and my bad luck was out to get me at this opportune timing. This man was acting like a fortune teller, telling me all sorts of bizarre things and random predictions before suddenly asking for money, to which I refused, but he then continued with his spiel. They were all good things, but I was really bamboozled. He gave me a strange compliment, perhaps due to the language barrier (he was a foreigner).<br><br>

I can’t overstate how ludicrous it is to run into so many weirdos frequently especially where I’m from, where it is the norm to keep to yourself. If you think you’re a relatively lucky person, just know that all your bad luck has probably just transferred over to me, to keep the balance in the world… I may need a heavy duty talisman. <br><br>

I ended the day with feeding the overweight cat some Churu. To gain an animal’s trust is an inexplicably beautiful journey.<br><br>

In other news, it is now my birthday month! 🎈

          August ends with a beautiful cloudy day, with some drizzling rain. The <s>feral</s>overweight cat who was once very scared now always comes to me with a meow. He even came all the way to the “territory” of the other cats today, even when the tabby cat he once fought with was there! They didn’t seem to mind each other, so maybe the beef is squashed 😸

        </p>
        <p>30.8.25<br><br>
          Today I went to that old cafe again! If only it weren’t so crowded, it’d be the perfect study location, but I guess that’s to be expected of a weekend. Today is also the day I discovered what an <i>Affogato</i> is!!! It’s…… <b>really</b> good… <br><br>

If it weren’t for a random google search I’d probably be suffering right now after consuming a copious amount of milk… Luckily, I think I can tolerate a little bit of ice cream! … Maybe. <br><br>

In the end, I always go back to a familiar place, a creature of habit. <br><br>

I’m now reading <i>The Housekeeper and the Professor</i> by Yoko Ogawa. I am even reading on the bus now, even though I used to be afraid of looking like I was doing it to be performative.

          I encountered a really cute Shiba Inu dog at the bus stop. It wanted to play… It tried to jump on me, and gave me a boop on my leg! Thank you…

          Another long day, my neck hurts, and it pains me even to sit. The suffocating classroom. The endless fidgeting during 3 long hours that feel like days. The constant discomfort in my own skin, the way I am sitting, how I am resting my face, the frequency of blinks. The crowded room. The cacophony of sounds that I wish would just pause for even one second. The <i>hunger</i>. Oh, the hunger. <br><br>

And the cold skin that grows colder, exacerbated by it. <br><br>

Sometimes, I wonder if I should have decided to dedicate my life to the violin at 14. Music, and art, imparts meaning even when you are not specifically looking for it. <br><br>

Recently, I read “Man’s Search for Meaning” by Viktor Frankl. Something that will always prove to be futile and fruitless over and over again is trying to find “answers” or “meaning” in books about those very things. (Yes, even if they’re from Greek philosophers.) The second half of the book severely disappointed me. I am happy that I did not spend my money on a physical copy (I almost always read physical books only) - I downloaded the PDF this time. <br><br>

I think I will stick to reading words that I give my own meaning to. 







        </p>
        
        <p>27.8.25<br><br>
          Today I sat in the wrong classroom right up until 3 minutes before the lesson started, when the professor walked in and I realised I did not recognise him. I almost thought he was a substitute… I sit in this classroom for another class, so I got it mixed up. <br><br>

I immediately packed all my things up and rushed to the correct classroom (which is luckily right beside this one). Embarrassing moment skilfully avoided!!!<br><br>

In class, there is a faint pleasant smell emanating through the air, maybe the perfume of one of the girls sitting near me. I am very sensitive to smells, and dislike many, so this was a nice surprise. <br><br>

On the way home, I ran into that guy again, who only said a simple hello this time and left me alone, thank god. It is not a mere coincidence, for I had not seen him once since February until earlier this month. I don’t want to see him ever again.<br><br>

The effectiveness of my lucky charm seems to be weaning a bit. <br><br>

At the end of the day, no matter what happens, for a short respite I get to visit the cats on my way back home, and it heals me of everything that has exhausted me throughout the day. Love has the power to do that. At least we share in the misfortune of dealing with unwanted and uncomfortable interactions from annoying strangers.<br><br>

This too shall pass.

          I’ve officially gotten the feral kitty (and the orange kitty!) hooked on Temptations (a brand of cat treats). They must have some illegal substances in there because <b>every</b> cat loves it; I’ve tried a few different flavours and the tuna flavour seems to be the ~NUMBER ONE PICK~. Although, I always feel guilty after feeding the feral cat, since he is so obese that his width cannot be measured with one hand alone….. <br><br>

I have a little history with Temptations. When I was 13, I befriended a stray black cat right outside my house. I was living on the ground floor at that time and while it was terrifying dealing with the scariest looking centipedes appearing in my kitchen sink or emerging from the SHOWER DRAIN, the only silver lining was that cat who was always waiting for me, less than 10 metres from my front door… <br><br>

A friend of mine taught me how to pet cats, introduced me to Temptations, and gradually any fear or hesitation I had subsided. It helps that black cats tend to be the friendliest of them all! Over the years I stayed in that house, I went around and played with other cats living nearby too, but I had the strongest bond with that black cat. It always ate treats from the palm of my hand… I never realised how much it trusted me, to let me do that. <br><br>

I’ve never tried to feed another cat from my hand since, for some reason. I suppose it will forever remain our special, sacred thing. <br><br>

<s>Oh, and one time it gave me a fungal infection. </s><br><br>
<b>LATER IN THE DAY</b><br><br>
I arrived early for class and sat somewhere outside the building to read my book. I’m now reading <i>The Lover</i> by Marguerite Duras. <br><br>

A few tables away, I saw the two girls who sit next to me in class - one of them was crying while the other was hugging her. They then came to class like nothing had happened, I didn’t want to probe, but I hope everything’s alright. <br><br>

Class felt excruciatingly long. I didn’t even  manage to get a drink during the break, as I figured the wait would be too long. Before class, I always plan to go to the park to read and dissociate from my responsibilities, but I’m always left so drained after that I just want to return home. <br><br>

On the bus back home, the man sitting in front of me has his phone screen in the bus windows, and I see that he’s on a group video call with his friends. <br><br>

Another woman nearby is also on a video call with a friend. <br><br>

<i>Love is all around me.</i>
</p>
        <p>21.8.25<br><br>
On Thursdays I have two classes back to back, which means 6 hours of classes with some breaks in between that are so short I don’t even feel like they really happened. <br><br>

I hurriedly ate half an onigiri before my second class, and I can’t believe I have to do this for the rest of the semester.<br><br>

I’m exhausted and don’t want to move an inch of my body after everything. Luckily, my bus home arrived almost immediately! <br><br>

I walked back home safely in the late night, making sure to visit the cats.<br><br>

The orange kitty seemed especially happy today, even making biscuits for a while! I noticed he always starts purring whenever he sees me. <br><br>





</p>
        <p>20.8.25<br><br>
          I ate the wafer the sweet girl gave me during my break.<br><br>

On the way back home, an older man spotted me in the mall and followed me as I walked outside, to my bus stop. <br><br>
<i>How much faster do I have to walk?</i> <br><br>
It really startled me as he tapped my shoulder (as these kinds of interactions usually do, since I always have my earphones in.) Needless to say, what followed was typical. He did mention that I looked like a student, “much much younger than 30”, which is obviously his age. Then he asked how old I thought he looked.. I couldn’t care less. I didn’t answer truthfully so as to not upset him, but he truly looked like he was in his 40's. Then he tried justifying the age difference. Repulsive... animalistic. <br><br>

The longer the interaction, the longer I’m left shaken up afterwards, my heart palpitating, even now still. Yet if I dismiss them immediately, they might get aggressive, and I do not feel comfortable turning my back on them before ending the interaction properly, so I always hear them out for a moment. These interactions always start with an apology for startling me. <br><br>


I suppose you must be tired of reading my dismal encounters with men by now; I sure am tired of writing about them.<br><br>

Just very recently, I decided to make a pair of ear cuffs my ‘lucky charms’, for no reason at all - it’s not like I am particularly lucky on the days i have them on, but I suppose if you believe…<br><br>

I didn’t wear my lucky ear cuffs today since I was in a rush. Tomorrow I definitely will. Maybe a cap too, or is my naivete fooling me into thinking that that will work?
        </p>
        <p>18.8.25<br><br>
          I’ve found solace in the fact that I’m very much an outsider in the world, in my world even. It’s not a very pleasant existence, to roam the world with nothing that drives you, nothing that needs you, nothing that connects you to… love, I suppose. <br><br>

Not romantic love, yet also not platonic love, what is it..? A joie de vivre perhaps - <i>a love for life itself</i>. <br><br>

“So the world boils down to nothing more than this.” <i>('Life for Sale', Yukio Mishima)</i> <br><br>

But then again so many people are just the same, so my ailments are trivial and worthless.. is what I’d say if I were in denial and trying to convince myself to surrender to nihilism. An easy escape, pitiful are all its victims, yet no one really has any pity for them.<br><br>

I don’t have delusions of grandeur, and I never dreamt of a meaningful life from the start - meaningful in anyone’s eyes. Though I guess when you don’t dream, you don’t get anything. <br><br>
<b>LATER IN THE DAY</b><br><br>
First day of classes. There seems to be so many more people than previous years, is it just me? <br><br>

I sat next to two really kind girls and one of them gave me a chocolate wafer during the break. 

        </p>
        <p>15.8.25<br><br>
          I left the house earlier today and I’ll be able to make it to the park before sunset! The feral cat is still nowhere to be found.. His ‘house’ is a parking lot, so I really hope he didn’t get hurt. <br><br>


          I found a chicken at the bus stop! I saw it climb/fly up a tree. I guess I know where they all go at night now.<br><br>
          
          My own mother just walked past me while I was waiting for the bus but was so glued to her phone that she didn’t notice me at all.<br><br>
          
          The weather is getting colder lately, to my content.<br><br>
          
          A turtle who poked its head out the water out of curiosity, made me think of my own turtles that I had growing up who grew so large that we had to release them. I truly hope they’re still alive somewhere.<br><br>
          
          I found the swan in my favourite area of the park, the lily pad pond, it seemed to be cleaning its feathers.<br><br>
          
          I took yet another route again, not on purpose but thanks to my poor sense of direction, this time passing by the waterfall. <br><br>
          
          Walking back home in the darkness… for some reason the street lamps aren’t lit today for this long road to the train station, I almost can’t see anything at all, even the two people who are only about 10m in front of me.. I find it really ironic that I’m so unnerved because I’m dressed in almost all white today, with my hair down, and I know that if I saw someone like me walking in the darkness, I would be scared to death.<br><br>
          
          I saw the black swans again, but this time they were in the water. My camera’s automatic flash embarrassed me.<br><br>
          
          Later at night I found the feral kitty. I’m so relieved. Of course I sneaked in multiple pets while he was eating the treats I gave him. He always comes to me now. </p>
        <p>14.8.25<br><br>
          I just refuse to let some kid scare me into staying home and not visiting my cat friends that I’ve known for years, so today I headed out in the evening again. I definitely don’t plan on being very polite to him if he tries anything yet again, I guess I’ve successfully <s> gaslighted </s> convinced myself that it isn’t a big deal.<br><br>

          I’m now constantly stricken with paranoia, more than I usually already am. Today, this one guy kept staring at me from afar as I exited the mall. He was just standing there, but started to walk in my direction once I got closer. I wasn’t sure, but I wasn’t taking any chances. I immediately went up some stairs to separate myself from him after a few moments and walked quickly to the bus stop (which was way further out), and he didn’t follow. <br><br>
          
          At least, it does seem safer at the park.<br><br>
          
          But thankfully today I did not see the guy from yesterday. <br><br>
          
          What I did see was my cat friends though. A super cute moment occurred: one of them was laying down and looked up at me twice with his tongue out to ask for more pets. Cats always seem to stick their tongue out a bit when they’re happy, which is so adorable it kills me. <br><br>
          
          I haven’t seen the feral cat in a few days and I miss him. </p>
        <p>13.8.25 <br><br>
          Today I went to a “new” cafe, well, it’s actually one I held a vendetta against for the longest time after eating something REALLY bad from this place.<br><br>

          I brought the book <i>The Flowers of Buffoonery</i> by Osamu Dazai with me. I remember I read <i>No Longer Human</i>, his most popular work, many years ago, when I was a heavily depressed teenager. From what I recall, I really liked it, but I can’t say if I still do before I reread it. <br><br>
          
          I’m only 25 pages in, but I’m reminded of the way I loved his writing style so fervently. The way he writes… is truly like no other. The writing style or “voice” of authors don’t usually stand out to me, but he wrote in such a way that the words come to life. It’s like he’s speaking to me, and he’s so, so similar to me that it’s a little painful.<br><br>
          
          A toddler keeps crying, and I can’t read. <br><br>
          
          I decided to go home, and I was playing with a cat when I suddenly caught eye of <i>that</i> guy again, walking from afar. This time the interaction went around 5,000 times worse, because he followed me home. The moment I caught a glimpse of him (I wasn’t even sure because of the distance), I started to walk away immediately. He must’ve had to run to catch up with me, because when I was almost outside of my building, he called out to me from behind, just a few steps away from me. <br><br>
          
          I am intimidated by almost every single stranger, especially at night. He asked for a couple things, and he let me say no when I was obviously hesitant, but kept walking in front of me, and lied saying he stays near me.. <br><br>
          
          I know that in these situations, you must never go home, but we were practically outside the building; my building is at the corner of the neighbourhood, and if I chose to not go to my building, the only choice left was the really dark and long alleyway beside it.<br><br>
          
          I’m not very good at estimating age based off someone’s face, but if he’s really just a teenager, I should have nothing to worry about…</p>
        <p>10.8.25<br><br>
          Today I was very unlucky. After deliberating on whether I should go out or not, I eventually went out pretty late and got approached by that guy who gave me free cat food all the way back in February. So many things had to fall into place for me to be this unlucky, it amazes me. I thought (or was hoping) he mistook me for someone else he knew. Maybe I should’ve pretended to not remember him, but I’m not exactly good at acting.<br><br>

I wish it didn’t, but small things like this <b>really</b> rattle me. <br><br>

I wish I lived in the mountains. <br><br>

I have cat fur all over my phone and on my face and it’s almost debilitating. 

        </p>
        <p>9.8.25<br><br>
          The tabby kitty caught a lizard in front of me today and meowed at me afterwards. Are you asking for my praise? <br><br>

The barista drew a really cute duck on my drink.<br><br>

On the bus back home I saw a kid with Spiderverse stickers on his iPad!
        </p>
        <p>4.8.25<br><br>
          Growing up, I’ve always thought of my mother as overly emotional, so much so that it was suffocating just to witness. But now every so often, I become so full of despair that it reminds me of her mercurial tendencies. <br><br>

She used to have a diary, though she made a halfhearted attempt to conceal it in a planner crowded with other work related writings. I could never understand her handwriting, but the little I could understand, it was not good. I later clarified that she was writing things like “I just have to hang in there for a little while more.”
        </p>
        <p>3.8.25<br><br>
          Well, what can I say besides it is August, and the summer break I’ve wasted away moping around directionless like a wheel that has spun off its axle has passed me by. But life will always be mostly spent directionless for all, won’t it? Despite one’s best efforts to plan everything out to the last detail, conjuring up grand visions of fulfilling goals and ambitions, it could all fall apart in a second. <br><br>

          That is why I want to be free from the shackles of irrational fear. This fear that serves no purpose but to only fill me with dread.. <br><br>
          
          At the very least, I’ve started reading again. <br><br>
          
          Today I tried feeding the orange kitty, but he didn’t want food. He seems to still have dental issues, which is strange because he’s supposed to have that fixed by now from the vet appointment some feeders took him to a while ago. <br><br>
          
          So instead, I had to give it to the other cats, including the feral cat, who always takes the food. He is REALLY overweight, and I usually never befriend cats using food at all, but I supposed scared/feral kitties are wired differently, so this is what I have to do. <br><br>
          
          He comes to me really close now when I shake the treat bag and meows! He seems to be indecisive about whether he likes head pats though, so I will continue to take things reeaaally slow until he likes me more. There were so many bees around, and I kept going back and forth trying to avoid them, he must’ve been super weirded out..<br><br>
          
          At night, while I was petting the cats, a strange man came up and stood behind me, smiling. It was extremely unnerving and I left immediately. It left me pretty upset.

          <p>30.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I accidentally stepped on the paw of the orange cat and he let out a yelp so loud I was in shock for a moment. He always follows me so closely and it was completely my fault but I know I really messed up this time, because he walked away from me as I tried asking for forgiveness…<br><br> 

I really hope our years of friendship aren’t gone just like that because of my stupidity.<br><br> 

I went back at night to apologise and he seemed to forgive me a little. I have to stop being so clumsy. 
          </p>
          <p>29.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I went to the bookstore, and got some freebies along with the book I bought! The staff actually gave me another bookmark at first, then switched it out to some Penguin-exclusive one because I bought a Penguin classic book, which bummed me out because the Penguin one is super plain in comparison. I also got a Penguin exclusive book pin, of the book “Confessions and Impressions” by Ethel Mannin. <br><br> 
            I'm in desperate need of bookmarks - I've been using this random receipt as a bookmark for the book I'm currently reading.
          </p>
          <p>27.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I fed the feral cat some treats again, and sneaked in some pets. He’s definitely not as afraid of me anymore.<br><br> 

I went to the park but it was so crowded - it was packed. I started to get a headache and I didn’t walk far before turning back. I feel… as though my favourite place was taken away from me, too soon. I haven’t seen the swan in a long time. 
<br><br> 
I flinched really badly upon turning the corner at night on the way home today when I saw this guy who happened to be walking towards me. He was just on his phone, minding his business, but I completely jolted. It was devastatingly embarrassing and I hope I never come across him again. 
          </p>
          <p>25.7.25<br><br> 
            Found the feral cat at night and I got a few meows out of him! He seemed at ease and laid down comfortably even while I was close to him, and even looked away a couple times. I gave him a couple treats, he’s really overweight but unfortunately this is the only way I’ll be able to get close to him! He always looks so sad, and it makes me sad. A man walking by tried to scare him off but stopped when he saw me and smiled like nothing happened. <br><br>

I watched a few “feral cat becomes friendly” YouTube videos to gain confidence. 
            </p>
          <p>24.7.25<br><br>
            When I went to see the feral cat again, I saw a different woman feeding the cats. I was pspspsp-ing him, when she appeared out of nowhere and startled me a bit. She seemed apologetic and I was a little embarrassed. She told me his name, but I’m not sure if he knows it’s his name... I left immediately. I guess the feral kitty and I have more in common than I had thought.<br><br>

            I also visited the playful cat who scratched me, and only pet him sparingly this time. I was walking away while watching him, to make sure he wouldn’t try to stop me leaving with his claws again. He followed me, and I figured that I should just stand there unmoving, until he gets bored. But he then proceeded to bite me on my leg, as if to scold me for not petting him. It was a “love bite”, so it didn’t hurt, but this is all a first for me, and I’m not sure how to deal with it. </p>
          <p>23.7.25<br><br>
          Wednesdays always seem to be especially bad for me. after a gruelling battle with myself today, I went for a walk. <br><br>

Today the feral cat in my neighbourhood let me pet him on the head and seemed to like it! I was really happy. <br><br>

At the entrance of the park, a baby in a stroller smiled at me when we made eye contact. This instantly lifted my mood, and of course, I smiled back. <br><br>

I got attacked by mosquitoes as I sat on a bench to try to read so I didn’t stay there for long. Just as when I was finally beginning to recover from the dozens of bites all over my legs… <br><br>

On the way out I was approached and helped a group of older ladies take a group photo. They looked really cute posing with their peace signs. <br><br>

On the way home, I saw an elderly man try to scare/hit the cats with his water bottle. The life of a stray cat is indeed unforgiving. I visited the feral cat again at night, and he let me pet him again on the head but I tried chin scritches and he swatted at me. I left after that to not risk making him more upset. Either way, I’ll be more careful going forward and try to take things slow.<br><br>

I got scratched for the first time successfully   by a cat who tried to stop me from leaving as I stood up. I was pretty shocked, no cat has ever behaved like this with me before.. I barely bled, so it’s okay. I think he thinks I’m a.. giant cat toy?

              I went back to the same cafe today, and the friendly waiter from months before in April, and he recognised me (to my horror) and all of our previous interactions. <br><br>

 I have no idea how someone can have that good of a facial memory. Maybe it’s a skill he’s honed over time as a waiter.<br><br>

I am very appreciative of the gesture, but I’d rather be a nonentity in someone’s mind. <br><br>

I am going to have to find a new cafe.

          <p>17.7.25<br><br>
          I witnessed a couple heartwarming moments of motherhood today. At the park, a mother running to her small child and he to her, both with their arms outstretched.<br><br>
        On the way back home, a mother carrying her child sideways like a little handbag.</p>
          <p>15.7.25<br><br>
            I really like going out at night. It gives me a chance to “redeem” myself after failing to do so in the day. <br><br>

            I went to that cafe again, and recognised 2 waiters. With my jazz playlist blaring through my earphones that make a pathetic effort to mask the cacophony of noises coming from patrons, I read my book slowly because of divided attention. <br><br>
            
            Attention that was split between looking at strangers passing by in the corner of my eye through the large glass window I was sat next to, and the people that sat nearby me. The waiters that occasionally walked by. The loud gossip (which was pretty unpleasant.) The birthday celebrations. <br><br>
            
            Despite only getting to around 40 pages, in a place where all kinds of voices and noises filling my head, I was almost moved to tears by the words I was reading. <br><br>
            
            Getting back into reading again is only difficult for me because it requires a level of focus and emotional commitment, but I can never put the book down once I start reading it.<br><br>
          I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_izqyuZpLo&list=RDY_izqyuZpLo&start_radio=1">this song. </a> </p>
          <p>7.7.25<br><br>
            Yet another trip to the SAME park, but everyday is different, I think...?<br><br>

            I walked from one end of the park to the other today, and though I’ve done it once before, I did not feel like I was on the verge of collapsing, my stamina must be improving! <br><br>
            
            I happened to run into a tourist who asked me where the metro was, and when she thanked me, I thanked her back. Sigh… <br><br>
            
            
            The park is a beautiful place. The most my interest has piqued in strangers was when I saw them sitting on different benches - some alone, some with their family, some with friends, or their significant other I love spending a couple hours walking around just observing people. (aAnd some with theirtheir cute dogs, of course.) Everyone was so strangely beautiful today. Beautiful in a different way that I usually find them to be; the feeling of wanting to unfold every single stranger’s past is not one that I usually come across. As much as I want to know, ultimately I know I’d be far too burdened by the weight of it all. <br><br>

It was peaceful but overwhelming at the same time. <br><br>

As the sun set, I waited for the black swans to hopefully appear before me a second time, but today they did not. <br><br>
I am curious about all the lives I see before me and all the different stories. I had this thought recently - that I could probably watch a series or movie made about any random stranger’s life, and really enjoy it.

          <p>5.7.25<br><br>
            There are days where I am plagued by fatigue for no apparent reason - I just simply cannot fully get out of bed before 5pm. It is as if my back has been anchored to my bed by mysterious forces that are totally not laziness! <br><br>

            I ventured out to the park despite this, knowing that it is so dark I’ll barely be able to see anything. <br><br>
            
            There, I met the swan, who wagged its tail at me and came closer, though I still sensed a bit of apprehension. I read online that swans understand bowing as a greeting, so I bowed a few times to it, but I’m unsure if it understood… We shall meet again when it’s brighter.
            <br><br>
            It was a lot darker than what was shown on my camera, and the atmosphere was just perfect as usual, albeit evoking a different mood than in the day.<br><br>
    <b>THE NEXT DAY</b>
    <br><br>
    Even after a whole night of being unable to sleep, I still find my way back here. Going early only means more hours of exploration! (in the hottest time of the year..) Who knew that walking for hours on end with no goal in mind, for the sake of the experience, could make my heart feel so full? Ah, but I’m sure you knew that already!<br><br>
    
    I am in a cranky mood, sleep deprived and all puffy, as I breathe in the air imbued with petrichor from the rain that ended just a moment ago, and I feel much better. On the bus ride to the park, I’m ever so slightly excited to see the same things I’ve seen multiple times.. why does it never fail to fulfil me? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRnnhMetvfg&list=RDJRnnhMetvfg&start_radio=1"><u>I don’t need, I don’t eat, I don’t sleep. I’m in love again.</u></a><br><br>
    
    Seeing many people out and about is nice, but the world does seem very beautiful at this time of day - empty except for tourists, the elderly and the unemployed. <br><br>
    
    The swan seemed to recognise this elderly man, whom I think works here, and immediately went up to him to and followed him as he greeted the swan! It was very lovely to watch, I thought to myself, I want to become friends with the swan too… <br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0301 2-min.JPG"><br>
    It slowly made its way over to me, and wagged its tail...<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0307 2-min.JPG"><br>
    Then later, it dipped its head in the water and snorted at me! It didn’t do that to anyone else!!! I couldn’t stop giggling for a while, I didn’t know swans were this adorable and friendly! Now, I have a reason to come back even more frequently. <br><br>
    
    
    It started raining again, and I wandered aimlessly with my umbrella as my only companion. Through the humid rain, my legs ached, but the song of the birds and the sound of the raindrops as they hit the ground helped me carry on. I can’t say that I’ve had other experiences that felt as healing as this. The birds led me to this bench underneath a canopy, overlooking more ponds with lily pads floating.. I sat to recuperate my energy.<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0348_jpg 2-min.JPG"><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0351 2-min.JPG"><br>
    I sat here for a short respite from carrying the umbrella while walking in the rain, and researched swan behaviour until I realised what I think was A BIG ANT CRAWLING ON MY HEAD, which I accidentally flicked onto my phone. My research findings concluded that it was a greeting snort, and left the area with haste! And of course, I decided I will make it my mission to befriend the swan with just my mind and vibes alone (because it’s illegal to feed them.) I also think that there should be more documentation on swan behaviour!<br><br>
    
    
    
    I walked and then found something familiar, an inkling of a memory being rekindled..<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0384 2-min.JPG"><br>
    
    But just a bit more… and I’ve reached where I was before years ago! The waterfall… with them, with everyone, the photography club I ‘led’ in high school… <br><br>
    
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0397 2-min.JPG"><br>
    I suppressed my emotions to the best of my ability, because the second I entered the cave, some memories from those all years ago came flooding back - although my memory fails me, because I cannot recall every single moment. Still shots from a film that became lost media is the best way I can describe it. We took so many pictures that were lost to time - no, erased - yet it may be that my memories were wiped quicker than the storage memory of the DSLR cameras we used. <br><br>
    
    I have this fear of dropping anything I own in a large body of water - no matter how insignificant the item is, I just don’t want to lose anything to the void forevermore. But this is exactly what the human brain does to us, everyday..  it is so cruel, so grotesque that it disgusts me to even talk about it. <br><br>
    
    The only thing saving us from this cruelty is the longevity of images.. it transfers onto our memories, letting us feel, smell, see, hear… several moments from the past. Between being crippled by fear of the future or mourning the past, I’d choose the latter any day. <br><br>
    
    The only shortcoming of images, is the absence of feelings. If only I could make you feel what I feel..
    <br><br>
    So, I know that if I just had those pictures today, I’d never forget, never... <br><br>
    
    If I had the energy or the stamina, I’m sure I would have accumulated so, so many more memories by now, than what I currently store in my mind. I wonder if I could even make a short film, with my current storage memory. A story… the most important part of a story to me is the finale. The end determines everything.<br><br>
    
    At the end of this trip, I passed the Swan Lake again, saying my goodbyes to the friendly swan. I felt like I was being followed?! <br><br>
    
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjvH6d3WY9Y"><u>A lonely swan</u></a>... I promise, I’ll come see you again. <br><br>
    
    What I feel now… a <i>metamorphosis</i>? Nothing in me has radically changed, but my heart just feels more full, being in this place, writing to no one. I feel at peace. <br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0412 2-min.JPG"><br>
    
    The following night, I slept for ages, while dreaming of the.. park? Except what I saw was more like a huge forest. For some reason, I was travelling along a car road, being swallowed by tall pine trees. Passing by many ponds with swans in them. It was a beautiful dream.  <br><br>
    
    I want to make a film.  <br><br> </p>
