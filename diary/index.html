i feel like i give off the totally opposite impression of who i really am online. i think i come off as someone who is
full of love, all while being someone who is actually severely lacking in it. ironically, despite my name, i think many
people would call me a monster. my given name, ‚Äúangel‚Äù, is not a fake nickname or something i came up with, so it may
have given off the impression that i think i am truly an ‚Äúangel‚Äù that radiates hope and light, or it is some sort of
persona. but it is merely just a name. the only thing i have in common with what we think of when we hear about ‚Äúangels‚Äù
is maybe that we all have no family, and spend our lives in solitude.
<br>
<br>
i remember seeing one of my mutuals tweet (although maybe it has nothing to do with me), ‚Äúwhat makes you think you have
the right to call yourself an angel?‚Äù or something along those lines. the mutual was a foreign account, so maybe they
didn‚Äôt know it could also be a name in english. either way, they had a point. i don‚Äôt really deserve my name.

awhile ago i was watching the movie Wings of Desire (1987), it‚Äôs a movie about angels. i didn‚Äôt finish it (i plan to),
but i remember thinking how that is simply the perfect existence to me. being invisible, and helping people through
mysterious ways that they‚Äôll never know about. watching people. observing. of course, it wouldn‚Äôt all be to my benefit.
that‚Äôs selfish and evil. i‚Äôd have to witness suffering too. but i will suffer along with them. with all of my heart, i
am hoping that i can become such an existence after i am long gone from this earth.
<br>
<br>
as a kid, people would always ask, who do you love most in your life? and most people would reply with their parents as
number one, or, if you wanted to be different, maybe you‚Äôd say you loved yourself most, and then your parents. for me,
my friends were always of higher priority than my family and myself, no question. you could say i considered them my
real family.
<br>
<br>
i used to fantasise about being an orphan. then about other worlds in which ‚Äúfamily‚Äù simply does not exist. whose blood
you were comprised of, didn‚Äôt matter at all. we were all separated from our parents at birth, and put into an orphanage.
you chose your family and found your own people. i told this to someone, and i think they said it was dystopian, but to
me, it was utopia. it is very ignorant of me to think that way but i can‚Äôt change it. in one of my classes last year, my
professor asked me, what i thought constitutes as a family. to me, family is just all in your head!

I wanted to write a log summarising my 2024! It‚Äôs already almost February but I figured I should write while I have the chance, since I‚Äôm on a short break.
<br>
I‚Äôm not sure if I had ever been as depressed or borderline suicidal as I was in Sept‚ÄìNov 2023, and I decided to seek professional help in January 2024. I have always been very adverse towards and skeptical of therapy, it was really a last resort sort of thing. Unfortunately, my experience has only confirmed my beliefs that therapy would never work for me. In fact, I‚Äôd go so far to say it made it even worse temporarily, because I had to dredge up all the horrible, repressed memories that should‚Äôve stayed repressed and never thought about again. I genuinely believe this ‚Äì that forgetting is the only remedy to suffering.
<br>
<br>
You can‚Äôt undo what‚Äôs been done to you, or what you‚Äôve had the misfortune of experiencing. I really think I would‚Äôve spiralled if I had continued therapy, because I can‚Äôt bear to remember. Worst of all, now there is someone out there who has seen my face, seen me cry (ugh‚Ä¶.) and has had to witness my trauma dumping all in the span of the first 2 hours of meeting me. She seemed speechless, which only made me feel even worse. But it‚Äôs alright, because I know I can count on her to forget. I count on the 2 other people I‚Äôve trusted enough to tell some of my past to forget too. At least one of them definitely has forgotten by now. It brings me so much comfort, the idea of being forgotten‚Ä¶ I wonder, why does anyone want to be remembered? 
<br>
<br>
My memory has never been particularly amazing, but I remember many, many moments from my childhood, in detail, since my earliest memory from 2/3 years old. I heard of people completely blanking out traumatic memories, and I was always so envious of them. Those memories have not gotten a single bit hazier with the years gone by. Of course, I have a couple happy moments that I remember in great detail too. But they‚Äôre very brief, lasting about 3 seconds or less each. 
<br>
<br>
But then, in April, I went to the sea by myself and sat on the rocks. It‚Äôs where I realised how beautiful trees were, for the first time‚Ä¶

In the same month, I went to go see the flowers. It was such a tiring adventure, I really thought I wouldn‚Äôt make it at some point, but when I finally made it there it all seemed worth it. I can still feel the cold breeze and hear the noise of the waterfall looking at the images. It‚Äôs interesting how simple experiences like that can etch into your mind so permanently.

Skipping ahead to November, I attended the concert of one of my longtime favourite artists! I really dislike crowds and screaming, so I‚Äôm really picky with what events I choose to go to. This was my first ever concert! I cried a LOT, even to songs I have never cried to before, just 15 minutes into the show, because I was so overwhelmed with emotion. And when it came to the songs I actually cry to just listening on my own‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶. let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt in the first row. I know everybody says it, but it‚Äôs really surreal, looking at someone you‚Äôve only seen through a screen, in real life. Like wow, he exists!? And he made this music that had a real, huge impact on me. I was only a few rows away from the stage, but none of my pictures or videos came out clearly because of the darkness. But I could see him quite clearly with my own eyes. 
I don‚Äôt think you can see the audience super clearly from the stage because of all the lights, but I feel like he made eye contact at one point and smiled comfortingly while I was crying really hard. It doesn‚Äôt help that I was definitely the only person close to the stage bawling my eyes out‚Ä¶ But I am probably being delusional. üò∏

I still cry watching the videos back, I think this was the one moment where I truly felt grateful to be alive. And every time I rewatch the videos I took I feel that same sentiment again. Isn‚Äôt it crazy how someone could possess so much talent, brilliance, and most importantly love, that it materialises into real hope to someone?
<br>
<br>
Towards New Years‚Äô Eve, I got a bunch of casual, nice interactions with strangers that made me feel happy. In a way, 2024 was one of the better years in my life thus far! It will be hard for 2025 to top it, but I‚Äôll try my best. I am wishing you the best too. Thank you for reading.
