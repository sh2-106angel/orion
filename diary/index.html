          I ate the wafer the sweet girl gave me during my break.<br><br>

On the way back home, an older man spotted me in the mall and followed me as I walked outside, to my bus stop. <br><br>
<i>How much faster do I have to walk?</i> <br><br>
It really startled me as he tapped my shoulder (as these kinds of interactions usually do, since I always have my earphones in.) Needless to say, what followed was typical. He did mention that I looked like a student, “much much younger than 30”, which is perhaps his age? Then he asked how old I thought he looked if it was a "question on an exam".  I couldn’t care less. I didn’t answer truthfully - “In your 20’s” (ridiculous of me, as he looked like he was in his 40's) - so as to not upset him, and then he tried justifying the age difference. Repulsive. I will never step foot in that mall again because this is the second time I've been approached in that mall. Surely, it must be <b>cursed</b>.<br><br>

The longer the interaction, the longer I’m left shaken up afterwards, my heart palpitating, even now still. Yet if I dismiss them immediately, they might get aggressive, so I always hear them out for a moment. Always starting with an apology for startling me.. just don’t do it. <br><br>

I wish I had a friend by my side during moments like these - when you're alone it triggers their predator instinct. <br><br>

I suppose you must be tired of reading my dismal encounters with men by now; I sure am tired of writing about them.<br><br>

Just very recently, I decided to make a pair of ear cuffs my ‘lucky charms’, for no reason at all - it’s not like I am particularly lucky on the days i have them on, but I suppose if you believe…<br><br>

I didn’t wear my lucky ear cuffs today since I was in a rush. Tomorrow I definitely will. Maybe a cap too, or is my naivete fooling me into thinking that that will work?
        </p>
        <p>18.8.25<br><br>
          I’ve found solace in the fact that I’m very much an outsider in the world, in my world even. It’s not a very pleasant existence, to roam the world with nothing that drives you, nothing that needs you, nothing that connects you to… love, I suppose. <br><br>

Not romantic love, yet also not platonic love, what is it..? A joie de vivre perhaps - <i>a love for life itself</i>. <br><br>

“So the world boils down to nothing more than this.” <i>('Life for Sale', Yukio Mishima)</i> <br><br>

But then again so many people are just the same, so my ailments are trivial and worthless.. is what I’d say if I were in denial and trying to convince myself to surrender to nihilism. An easy escape, pitiful are all its victims, yet no one really has any pity for them.<br><br>

I don’t have delusions of grandeur, and I never dreamt of a meaningful life from the start - meaningful in anyone’s eyes. Though I guess when you don’t dream, you don’t get anything. <br><br>
<b>LATER</b><br><br>
First day of classes. There seems to be so many more people than previous years, is it just me? <br><br>

I sat next to two really kind girls and one of them gave me a chocolate wafer during the break. 

        </p>
        <p>15.8.25<br><br>
          I left the house earlier today and I’ll be able to make it to the park before sunset! The feral cat is still nowhere to be found.. His ‘house’ is a parking lot, so I really hope he didn’t get hurt. <br><br>


          I found a chicken at the bus stop! I saw it climb/fly up a tree. I guess I know where they all go at night now.<br><br>
          
          My own mother just walked past me while I was waiting for the bus but was so glued to her phone that she didn’t notice me at all.<br><br>
          
          The weather is getting colder lately, to my content.<br><br>
          
          A turtle who poked its head out the water out of curiosity, made me think of my own turtles that I had growing up who grew so large that we had to release them. I truly hope they’re still alive somewhere.<br><br>
          
          I found the swan in my favourite area of the park, the lily pad pond, it seemed to be cleaning its feathers.<br><br>
          
          I took yet another route again, not on purpose but thanks to my poor sense of direction, this time passing by the waterfall. <br><br>
          
          Walking back home in the darkness… for some reason the street lamps aren’t lit today for this long road to the train station, I almost can’t see anything at all, even the two people who are only about 10m in front of me.. I find it really ironic that I’m so unnerved because I’m dressed in almost all white today, with my hair down, and I know that if I saw someone like me walking in the darkness, I would be scared to death.<br><br>
          
          I saw the black swans again, but this time they were in the water. My camera’s automatic flash embarrassed me.<br><br>
          
          Later at night I found the feral kitty. I’m so relieved. Of course I sneaked in multiple pets while he was eating the treats I gave him. He always comes to me now. </p>
        <p>14.8.25<br><br>
          I just refuse to let some kid scare me into staying home and not visiting my cat friends that I’ve known for years, so today I headed out in the evening again. I definitely don’t plan on being very polite to him if he tries anything yet again, I guess I’ve successfully <s> gaslighted </s> convinced myself that it isn’t a big deal.<br><br>

          I’m now constantly stricken with paranoia, more than I usually already am. Today, this one guy kept staring at me from afar as I exited the mall. He was just standing there, but started to walk in my direction once I got closer. I wasn’t sure, but I wasn’t taking any chances. I immediately went up some stairs to separate myself from him after a few moments and walked quickly to the bus stop (which was way further out), and he didn’t follow. <br><br>
          
          At least, it does seem safer at the park.<br><br>
          
          But thankfully today I did not see the guy from yesterday. <br><br>
          
          What I did see was my cat friends though. A super cute moment occurred: one of them was laying down and looked up at me twice with his tongue out to ask for more pets. Cats always seem to stick their tongue out a bit when they’re happy, which is so adorable it kills me. <br><br>
          
          I haven’t seen the feral cat in a few days and I miss him. </p>
        <p>13.8.25 <br><br>
          Today I went to a “new” cafe, well, it’s actually one I held a vendetta against for the longest time after eating something REALLY bad from this place.<br><br>

          I brought the book “The Flowers of Buffoonery” by Osamu Dazai with me. I remember I read “No Longer Human”, his most popular work, many years ago, when I was a heavily depressed teenager. From what I recall, I really liked it, but I can’t say if I still do before I reread it. <br><br>
          
          I’m only 25 pages in, but I’m reminded of the way I loved his writing style so fervently. The way he writes… is truly like no other. The writing style or “voice” of authors don’t usually stand out to me, but he writes in such a way that make the words come to life. It’s like he’s speaking to me, and he’s so, so similar to me that it’s a little painful.<br><br>
          
          A toddler keeps crying, and I can’t read. <br><br>
          
          I decided to go home, and I was playing with a cat when I suddenly caught eye of <i>that</i> guy again, walking from afar. This time the interaction went around 5,000 times worse, because he followed me home. The moment I caught a glimpse of him (I wasn’t even sure because of the distance), I started to walk away immediately. He must’ve had to run to catch up with me, because when I was almost outside of my building, he called out to me from behind, just a few steps away from me. <br><br>
          
          I am intimidated by almost every single stranger, especially at night. He asked for a couple things, and he let me say no when I was obviously hesitant, but kept walking in front of me, and lied saying he stays near me.. <br><br>
          
          I know that in these situations, you must never go home, but we were practically outside the building; my building is at the corner of the neighbourhood, and if I chose to not go to my building, the only choice left was the really dark and long alleyway beside it.<br><br>
          
          I’m not very good at estimating age based off someone’s face, but if he’s really just a teenager, I should have nothing to worry about…</p>
        <p>10.8.25<br><br>
          Today I was very unlucky. After deliberating on whether I should go out or not, I eventually went out pretty late and got approached by that guy who gave me free cat food all the way back in February. So many things had to fall into place for me to be this unlucky, it amazes me. I thought (or was hoping) he mistook me for someone else he knew. Maybe I should’ve pretended to not remember him, but I’m not exactly good at acting.<br><br>

I wish it didn’t, but small things like this <b>really</b> rattle me. <br><br>

I wish I lived in the mountains. <br><br>

I have cat fur all over my phone and on my face and it’s almost debilitating. 

        </p>
        <p>9.8.25<br><br>
          The tabby kitty caught a lizard in front of me today and meowed at me afterwards. Are you asking for my praise? <br><br>

The barista drew a really cute duck on my drink.<br><br>

On the bus back home I saw a kid with Spiderverse stickers on his iPad!
        </p>
        <p>4.8.25<br><br>
          Growing up, I’ve always thought of my mother as overly emotional, so much so that it was suffocating just to witness. But now every so often, I become so full of despair that it reminds me of her mercurial tendencies. <br><br>

She used to have a diary, though she made a halfhearted attempt to conceal it in a planner crowded with other work related writings. I could never understand her handwriting, but the little I could understand, it was not good. I later clarified that she was writing things like “I just have to hang in there for a little while more.”
        </p>
        <p>3.8.25<br><br>
          Well, what can I say besides it is August, and the summer break I’ve wasted away moping around directionless like a wheel that has spun off its axle has passed me by. But life will always be mostly spent directionless for all, won’t it? Despite one’s best efforts to plan everything out to the last detail, conjuring up grand visions of fulfilling goals and ambitions, it could all fall apart in a second. <br><br>

          That is why I want to be free from the shackles of irrational fear. This fear that serves no purpose but to only fill me with dread.. <br><br>
          
          At the very least, I’ve started reading again. <br><br>
          
          Today I tried feeding the orange kitty, but he didn’t want food. He seems to still have dental issues, which is strange because he’s supposed to have that fixed by now from the vet appointment some feeders took him to a while ago. <br><br>
          
          So instead, I had to give it to the other cats, including the feral cat, who always takes the food. He is REALLY overweight, and I usually never befriend cats using food at all, but I supposed scared/feral kitties are wired differently, so this is what I have to do. <br><br>
          
          He comes to me really close now when I shake the treat bag and meows! He seems to be indecisive about whether he likes head pats though, so I will continue to take things reeaaally slow until he likes me more. There were so many bees around, and I kept going back and forth trying to avoid them, he must’ve been super weirded out..<br><br>
          
          At night, while I was petting the cats, a strange man came up and stood behind me, smiling. It was extremely unnerving and I left immediately. It left me pretty upset. 
          </p>

        <div id="7">
          <p>30.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I accidentally stepped on the paw of the orange cat and he let out a yelp so loud I was in shock for a moment. He always follows me so closely and it was completely my fault but I know I really messed up this time, because he walked away from me as I tried asking for forgiveness…<br><br> 

I really hope our years of friendship aren’t gone just like that because of my stupidity.<br><br> 

I went back at night to apologise and he seemed to forgive me a little. I have to stop being so clumsy. 
          </p>
          <p>29.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I went to the bookstore, and got some freebies along with the book I bought! The staff actually gave me another bookmark at first, then switched it out to some Penguin-exclusive one because I bought a Penguin classic book, which bummed me out because the Penguin one is super plain in comparison. I also got a Penguin exclusive book pin, of the book “Confessions and Impressions” by Ethel Mannin. <br><br> 
            I'm in desperate need of bookmarks - I've been using this random receipt as a bookmark for the book I'm currently reading.
          </p>
          <p>27.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I fed the feral cat some treats again, and sneaked in some pets. He’s definitely not as afraid of me anymore.<br><br> 

I went to the park but it was so crowded - it was packed. I started to get a headache and I didn’t walk far before turning back. I feel… as though my favourite place was taken away from me, too soon. I haven’t seen the swan in a long time. 
<br><br> 
I flinched really badly upon turning the corner at night on the way home today when I saw this guy who happened to be walking towards me. He was just on his phone, minding his business, but I completely jolted. It was devastatingly embarrassing and I hope I never come across him again. 
          </p>
          <p>25.7.25<br><br> 
            Found the feral cat at night and I got a few meows out of him! He seemed at ease and laid down comfortably even while I was close to him, and even looked away a couple times. I gave him a couple treats, he’s really overweight but unfortunately this is the only way I’ll be able to get close to him! He always looks so sad, and it makes me sad. A man walking by tried to scare him off but stopped when he saw me and smiled like nothing happened. <br><br>

I watched a few “feral cat becomes friendly” YouTube videos to gain confidence. 
            </p>
          <p>24.7.25<br><br>
            When I went to see the feral cat again, I saw a different woman feeding the cats. I was pspspsp-ing him, when she appeared out of nowhere and startled me a bit. She seemed apologetic and I was a little embarrassed. She told me his name, but I’m not sure if he knows it’s his name... I left immediately. I guess the feral kitty and I have more in common than I had thought.<br><br>

            I also visited the playful cat who scratched me, and only pet him sparingly this time. I was walking away while watching him, to make sure he wouldn’t try to stop me leaving with his claws again. He followed me, and I figured that I should just stand there unmoving, until he gets bored. But he then proceeded to bite me on my leg, as if to scold me for not petting him. It was a “love bite”, so it didn’t hurt, but this is all a first for me, and I’m not sure how to deal with it. </p>
          <p>23.7.25<br><br>
          Wednesdays always seem to be especially bad for me. after a gruelling battle with myself today, I went for a walk. <br><br>

Today the feral cat in my neighbourhood let me pet him on the head and seemed to like it! I was really happy. <br><br>

At the entrance of the park, a baby in a stroller smiled at me when we made eye contact. This instantly lifted my mood, and of course, I smiled back. <br><br>

I got attacked by mosquitoes as I sat on a bench to try to read so I didn’t stay there for long. Just as when I was finally beginning to recover from the dozens of bites all over my legs… <br><br>

On the way out I was approached and helped a group of older ladies take a group photo. They looked really cute posing with their peace signs. <br><br>

On the way home, I saw an elderly man try to scare/hit the cats with his water bottle. The life of a stray cat is indeed unforgiving. I visited the feral cat again at night, and he let me pet him again on the head but I tried chin scritches and he swatted at me. I left after that to not risk making him more upset. Either way, I’ll be more careful going forward and try to take things slow.<br><br>

I got scratched for the first time successfully   by a cat who tried to stop me from leaving as I stood up. I was pretty shocked, no cat has ever behaved like this with me before.. I barely bled, so it’s okay. I think he thinks I’m a.. giant cat toy?
</p>
           <p>19.7.25<br><br>
              I went back to the same cafe today, and the friendly waiter from months before in April, and he recognised me (to my horror) and all of our previous interactions. <br><br>

 I have no idea how someone can have that good of a facial memory. Maybe it’s a skill he’s honed over time as a waiter.<br><br>

I am very appreciative of the gesture, but I’d rather be a nonentity in someone’s mind. <br><br>

I am going to have to find a new cafe. 
           </p>
          <p>17.7.25<br><br>
          I witnessed a couple heartwarming moments of motherhood today. At the park, a mother running to her small child and he to her, both with their arms outstretched.<br><br>
        On the way back home, a mother carrying her child sideways like a little handbag.</p>
          <p>15.7.25<br><br>
            I really like going out at night. It gives me a chance to “redeem” myself after failing to do so in the day. <br><br>

            I went to that cafe again, and recognised 2 waiters. With my jazz playlist blaring through my earphones that make a pathetic effort to mask the cacophony of noises coming from patrons, I read my book slowly because of divided attention. <br><br>
            
            Attention that was split between looking at strangers passing by in the corner of my eye through the large glass window I was sat next to, and the people that sat nearby me. The waiters that occasionally walked by. The loud gossip (which was pretty unpleasant.) The birthday celebrations. <br><br>
            
            Despite only getting to around 40 pages, in a place where all kinds of voices and noises filling my head, I was almost moved to tears by the words I was reading. <br><br>
            
            Getting back into reading again is only difficult for me because it requires a level of focus and emotional commitment, but I can never put the book down once I start reading it.<br><br>
          I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_izqyuZpLo&list=RDY_izqyuZpLo&start_radio=1">this song. </a> </p>
          <p>7.7.25<br><br>
            Yet another trip to the SAME park, but everyday is different, I think...?<br><br>

            I walked from one end of the park to the other today, and though I’ve done it once before, I did not feel like I was on the verge of collapsing, my stamina must be improving! <br><br>
            
            I happened to run into a tourist who asked me where the metro was, and when she thanked me, I thanked her back. Sigh… <br><br>
            
            
            The park is a beautiful place. The most my interest has piqued in strangers was when I saw them sitting on different benches - some alone, some with their family, some with friends, or their significant other I love spending a couple hours walking around just observing people. (aAnd some with theirtheir cute dogs, of course.) Everyone was so strangely beautiful today. Beautiful in a different way that I usually find them to be; the feeling of wanting to unfold every single stranger’s past is not one that I usually come across. As much as I want to know, ultimately I know I’d be far too burdened by the weight of it all. <br><br>

It was peaceful but overwhelming at the same time. <br><br>

As the sun set, I waited for the black swans to hopefully appear before me a second time, but today they did not. <br><br>
I am curious about all the lives I see before me and all the different stories. I had this thought recently - that I could probably watch a series or movie made about any random stranger’s life, and really enjoy it. 



            </p>
          <p>5.7.25<br><br>
            There are days where I am plagued by fatigue for no apparent reason - I just simply cannot fully get out of bed before 5pm. It is as if my back has been anchored to my bed by mysterious forces that are totally not laziness! <br><br>

            I ventured out to the park despite this, knowing that it is so dark I’ll barely be able to see anything. <br><br>
            
            There, I met the swan, who wagged its tail at me and came closer, though I still sensed a bit of apprehension. I read online that swans understand bowing as a greeting, so I bowed a few times to it, but I’m unsure if it understood… We shall meet again when it’s brighter.
            <br><br>
            It was a lot darker than what was shown on my camera, and the atmosphere was just perfect as usual, albeit evoking a different mood than in the day.<br><br>
    <b>THE NEXT DAY</b>
    <br><br>
    Even after a whole night of being unable to sleep, I still find my way back here. Going early only means more hours of exploration! (in the hottest time of the year..) Who knew that walking for hours on end with no goal in mind, for the sake of the experience, could make my heart feel so full? Ah, but I’m sure you knew that already!<br><br>
    
    I am in a cranky mood, sleep deprived and all puffy, as I breathe in the air imbued with petrichor from the rain that ended just a moment ago, and I feel much better. On the bus ride to the park, I’m ever so slightly excited to see the same things I’ve seen multiple times.. why does it never fail to fulfil me? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRnnhMetvfg&list=RDJRnnhMetvfg&start_radio=1"><u>I don’t need, I don’t eat, I don’t sleep. I’m in love again.</u></a><br><br>
    
    Seeing many people out and about is nice, but the world does seem very beautiful at this time of day - empty except for tourists, the elderly and the unemployed. <br><br>
    
    The swan seemed to recognise this elderly man, whom I think works here, and immediately went up to him to and followed him as he greeted the swan! It was very lovely to watch, I thought to myself, I want to become friends with the swan too… <br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0301 2-min.JPG"><br>
    It slowly made its way over to me, and wagged its tail...<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0307 2-min.JPG"><br>
    Then later, it dipped its head in the water and snorted at me! It didn’t do that to anyone else!!! I couldn’t stop giggling for a while, I didn’t know swans were this adorable and friendly! Now, I have a reason to come back even more frequently. <br><br>
    
    
    It started raining again, and I wandered aimlessly with my umbrella as my only companion. Through the humid rain, my legs ached, but the song of the birds and the sound of the raindrops as they hit the ground helped me carry on. I can’t say that I’ve had other experiences that felt as healing as this. The birds led me to this bench underneath a canopy, overlooking more ponds with lily pads floating.. I sat to recuperate my energy.<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0348_jpg 2-min.JPG"><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0351 2-min.JPG"><br>
    I sat here for a short respite from carrying the umbrella while walking in the rain, and researched swan behaviour until I realised what I think was A BIG ANT CRAWLING ON MY HEAD, which I accidentally flicked onto my phone. My research findings concluded that it was a greeting snort, and left the area with haste! And of course, I decided I will make it my mission to befriend the swan with just my mind and vibes alone (because it’s illegal to feed them.) I also think that there should be more documentation on swan behaviour!<br><br>
    
    
    
    I walked and then found something familiar, an inkling of a memory being rekindled..<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0384 2-min.JPG"><br>
    
    But just a bit more… and I’ve reached where I was before years ago! The waterfall… with them, with everyone, the photography club I ‘led’ in high school… <br><br>
    
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0397 2-min.JPG"><br>
    I suppressed my emotions to the best of my ability, because the second I entered the cave, some memories from those all years ago came flooding back - although my memory fails me, because I cannot recall every single moment. Still shots from a film that became lost media is the best way I can describe it. We took so many pictures that were lost to time - no, erased - yet it may be that my memories were wiped quicker than the storage memory of the DSLR cameras we used. <br><br>
    
    I have this fear of dropping anything I own in a large body of water - no matter how insignificant the item is, I just don’t want to lose anything to the void forevermore. But this is exactly what the human brain does to us, everyday..  it is so cruel, so grotesque that it disgusts me to even talk about it. <br><br>
    
    The only thing saving us from this cruelty is the longevity of images.. it transfers onto our memories, letting us feel, smell, see, hear… several moments from the past. Between being crippled by fear of the future or mourning the past, I’d choose the latter any day. <br><br>
    
    The only shortcoming of images, is the absence of feelings. If only I could make you feel what I feel..
    <br><br>
    So, I know that if I just had those pictures today, I’d never forget, never... <br><br>
    
    If I had the energy or the stamina, I’m sure I would have accumulated so, so many more memories by now, than what I currently store in my mind. I wonder if I could even make a short film, with my current storage memory. A story… the most important part of a story to me is the finale. The end determines everything.<br><br>
    
    At the end of this trip, I passed the Swan Lake again, saying my goodbyes to the friendly swan. I felt like I was being followed?! <br><br>
    
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjvH6d3WY9Y"><u>A lonely swan</u></a>... I promise, I’ll come see you again. <br><br>
    
    What I feel now… a <i>metamorphosis</i>? Nothing in me has radically changed, but my heart just feels more full, being in this place, writing to no one. I feel at peace. <br><br>

    The following night, I slept for ages, while dreaming of the.. park? Except what I saw was more like a huge forest. For some reason, I was travelling along a car road, being swallowed by tall pine trees. Passing by many ponds with swans in them. It was a beautiful dream.  <br><br>
    
    I want to make a film.  <br><br> </p>
