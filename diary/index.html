          Well, what can I say besides it is August, and the summer break I’ve wasted away moping around directionless like a wheel that has spun off its axle has passed me by. But life will always be mostly spent directionless for all, won’t it? Despite one’s best efforts to plan everything out to the last detail, conjuring up grand visions of fulfilling goals and ambitions, it could all fall apart in a second. <br><br>

          That is why I want to be free from the shackles of irrational fear. This fear that serves no purpose but to only fill me with dread.. <br><br>
          
          At the very least, I’ve started reading again. <br><br>
          
          Today I tried feeding the orange kitty, but he didn’t want food. He seems to still have dental issues, which is strange because he’s supposed to have that fixed by now from the vet appointment some feeders took him to a while ago. <br><br>
          
          So instead, I had to give it to the other cats, including the feral cat, who always takes the food. He is REALLY overweight, and I usually never befriend cats using food at all, but I supposed scared/feral kitties are wired differently, so this is what I have to do. <br><br>
          
          He comes to me really close now when I shake the treat bag and meows! He seems to be indecisive about whether he likes head pats though, so I will continue to take things reeaaally slow until he likes me more. There were so many bees around, and I kept going back and forth trying to avoid them, he must’ve been super weirded out..<br><br>
          
          At night, while I was petting the cats, a strange man came up and stood behind me, smiling. It was extremely unnerving and I left immediately. It left me pretty upset. 
          </p>

          <p>30.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I accidentally stepped on the paw of the orange cat and he let out a yelp so loud I was in shock for a moment. He always follows me so closely and it was completely my fault but I know I really messed up this time, because he walked away from me as I tried asking for forgiveness…<br><br> 

I really hope our years of friendship aren’t gone just like that because of my stupidity.<br><br> 

I went back at night to apologise and he seemed to forgive me a little. I have to stop being so clumsy. 
          </p>
          <p>29.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I went to the bookstore, and got some freebies along with the book I bought! The staff actually gave me another bookmark at first, then switched it out to some Penguin-exclusive one because I bought a Penguin classic book, which bummed me out because the Penguin one is super plain in comparison. I also got a Penguin exclusive book pin, of the book “Confessions and Impressions” by Ethel Mannin. <br><br> 
            I'm in desperate need of bookmarks - I've been using this random receipt as a bookmark for the book I'm currently reading.
          </p>
          <p>27.7.25<br><br> 
            Today I fed the feral cat some treats again, and sneaked in some pets. He’s definitely not as afraid of me anymore.<br><br> 

I went to the park but it was so crowded - it was packed. I started to get a headache and I didn’t walk far before turning back. I feel… as though my favourite place was taken away from me, too soon. I haven’t seen the swan in a long time. 
<br><br> 
I flinched really badly upon turning the corner at night on the way home today when I saw this guy who happened to be walking towards me. He was just on his phone, minding his business, but I completely jolted. It was devastatingly embarrassing and I hope I never come across him again. 
          </p>
          <p>25.7.25<br><br> 
            Found the feral cat at night and I got a few meows out of him! He seemed at ease and laid down comfortably even while I was close to him, and even looked away a couple times. I gave him a couple treats, he’s really overweight but unfortunately this is the only way I’ll be able to get close to him! He always looks so sad, and it makes me sad. A man walking by tried to scare him off but stopped when he saw me and smiled like nothing happened. <br><br>

I watched a few “feral cat becomes friendly” YouTube videos to gain confidence. 
            </p>
          <p>24.7.25<br><br>
            When I went to see the feral cat again, I saw a different woman feeding the cats. I was pspspsp-ing him, when she appeared out of nowhere and startled me a bit. She seemed apologetic and I was a little embarrassed. She told me his name, but I’m not sure if he knows it’s his name... I left immediately. I guess the feral kitty and I have more in common than I had thought.<br><br>

            I also visited the playful cat who scratched me, and only pet him sparingly this time. I was walking away while watching him, to make sure he wouldn’t try to stop me leaving with his claws again. He followed me, and I figured that I should just stand there unmoving, until he gets bored. But he then proceeded to bite me on my leg, as if to scold me for not petting him. It was a “love bite”, so it didn’t hurt, but this is all a first for me, and I’m not sure how to deal with it. </p>
          <p>23.7.25<br><br>
          Wednesdays always seem to be especially bad for me. after a gruelling battle with myself today, I went for a walk. <br><br>

Today the feral cat in my neighbourhood let me pet him on the head and seemed to like it! I was really happy. <br><br>

At the entrance of the park, a baby in a stroller smiled at me when we made eye contact. This instantly lifted my mood, and of course, I smiled back. <br><br>

I got attacked by mosquitoes as I sat on a bench to try to read so I didn’t stay there for long. Just as when I was finally beginning to recover from the dozens of bites all over my legs… <br><br>

On the way out I was approached and helped a group of older ladies take a group photo. They looked really cute posing with their peace signs. <br><br>

On the way home, I saw an elderly man try to scare/hit the cats with his water bottle. The life of a stray cat is indeed unforgiving. I visited the feral cat again at night, and he let me pet him again on the head but I tried chin scritches and he swatted at me. I left after that to not risk making him more upset. Either way, I’ll be more careful going forward and try to take things slow.<br><br>

I got scratched for the first time successfully   by a cat who tried to stop me from leaving as I stood up. I was pretty shocked, no cat has ever behaved like this with me before.. I barely bled, so it’s okay. I think he thinks I’m a.. giant cat toy?
</p>
           <p>19.7.25<br><br>
              I went back to the same cafe today, and the friendly waiter from months before in April, and he recognised me (to my horror) and all of our previous interactions. <br><br>

 I have no idea how someone can have that good of a facial memory. Maybe it’s a skill he’s honed over time as a waiter.<br><br>

I am very appreciative of the gesture, but I’d rather be a nonentity in someone’s mind. <br><br>

I am going to have to find a new cafe. 
           </p>
          <p>17.7.25<br><br>
          I witnessed a couple heartwarming moments of motherhood today. At the park, a mother running to her small child and he to her, both with their arms outstretched.<br><br>
        On the way back home, a mother carrying her child sideways like a little handbag.</p>
          <p>15.7.25<br><br>
            I really like going out at night. It gives me a chance to “redeem” myself after failing to do so in the day. <br><br>

            I went to that cafe again, and recognised 2 waiters. With my jazz playlist blaring through my earphones that make a pathetic effort to mask the cacophony of noises coming from patrons, I read my book slowly because of divided attention. <br><br>
            
            Attention that was split between looking at strangers passing by in the corner of my eye through the large glass window I was sat next to, and the people that sat nearby me. The waiters that occasionally walked by. The loud gossip (which was pretty unpleasant.) The birthday celebrations. <br><br>
            
            Despite only getting to around 40 pages, in a place where all kinds of voices and noises filling my head, I was almost moved to tears by the words I was reading. <br><br>
            
            Getting back into reading again is only difficult for me because it requires a level of focus and emotional commitment, but I can never put the book down once I start reading it.<br><br>
          I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_izqyuZpLo&list=RDY_izqyuZpLo&start_radio=1">this song. </a> </p>
          <p>7.7.25<br><br>
            Yet another trip to the SAME park, but everyday is different, I think...?<br><br>

            I walked from one end of the park to the other today, and though I’ve done it once before, I did not feel like I was on the verge of collapsing, my stamina must be improving! <br><br>
            
            I happened to run into a tourist who asked me where the metro was, and when she thanked me, I thanked her back. Sigh… <br><br>
            
            
            The park is a beautiful place. The most my interest has piqued in strangers was when I saw them sitting on different benches - some alone, some with their family, some with friends, or their significant other I love spending a couple hours walking around just observing people. (aAnd some with theirtheir cute dogs, of course.) Everyone was so strangely beautiful today. Beautiful in a different way that I usually find them to be; the feeling of wanting to unfold every single stranger’s past is not one that I usually come across. As much as I want to know, ultimately I know I’d be far too burdened by the weight of it all. <br><br>

It was peaceful but overwhelming at the same time. <br><br>

As the sun set, I waited for the black swans to hopefully appear before me a second time, but today they did not. <br><br>
I am curious about all the lives I see before me and all the different stories. I had this thought recently - that I could probably watch a series or movie made about any random stranger’s life, and really enjoy it. 



            </p>
          <p>5.7.25<br><br>
            There are days where I am plagued by fatigue for no apparent reason - I just simply cannot fully get out of bed before 5pm. It is as if my back has been anchored to my bed by mysterious forces that are totally not laziness! <br><br>

            I ventured out to the park despite this, knowing that it is so dark I’ll barely be able to see anything. <br><br>
            
            There, I met the swan, who wagged its tail at me and came closer, though I still sensed a bit of apprehension. I read online that swans understand bowing as a greeting, so I bowed a few times to it, but I’m unsure if it understood… We shall meet again when it’s brighter.
            <br><br>
            It was a lot darker than what was shown on my camera, and the atmosphere was just perfect as usual, albeit evoking a different mood than in the day.<br><br>
            
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azj3YRI0yzU&list=RDazj3YRI0yzU&start_radio=1">Beneath a shadow, it comforts me. </a><br><br>
            
            I was afraid of freaking out the occasional runner (Long hair, pale skin and white clothes in near pitch black darkness… you get the gist) <br><br>
            
            So I ended up leaving pretty quickly - I definitely could never explore more of the park at night, because it is way too creepy. Most of the park is pretty much just a forest with roads. I must’ve spent merely 10 minutes or so there, yet I still felt that it was all worth it. It’s a strange place. <br><br>
            
            The sadness only took over me on the way back home. Recently, I’ve been feeling that way a lot more - not wanting to return home. <br><br>
            
            Although, playing with the neighbourhood stray cats soothes me a bit, that is, until a random man walks past while making strange noises at me.</p>
        <p>
          2.7.25<br><br>
    Once again, it is just me. Just like how things have always been. <br><br>

    To be truthful to myself and this place is what I wish for.<br><br>
    
    I have a hard time fathoming how and why I would ever occupy someone’s thoughts, so it genuinely never crosses my mind - but if you are still here, if you still care, if I’ve made you feel anything from these words, thank you. You have most likely made me feel so much more, that I started to wonder if being gifted words when I am unable to speak, write or even think, is the greatest gift of all. <br><br>
    
    Maybe it is being on the precipice of total exhaustion, of getting a heatstroke, lightheadedness, that makes me feel alive - because I’ve found myself returning to the park, mostly to visit Swan Lake, again and again. Going outside and exhausting the body and mind by overstimulating the senses to the point where you can’t think about anything but food and water is only a temporary solution to a permanent problem, but that’s been how I’ve been choosing to spend my days. <br><br>
    
    I set foot out the door, even as the sun is about to set, knowing that I won’t have very long…<br><br>
    
    So many different people frequent this garden, but in a certain area, though not really a hidden spot, I find myself in blissful solitude, a place where it feels like no one will ever find me. Where your gaze falls while looking across from this pond where the lily pads crowd together, is my “secret spot”. Where it is technically illegal to be after 7pm.. and I overstayed unknowingly…! And then no one saw me, so I was “barred” in… embarrassing as it is to admit...it did made me feel a little cool. <br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;" src="jul/IMG_0225 2-min.JPG"><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0240 2-min.JPG"><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0249 2-min.JPG"><br>
    
    My mind feels like the canvas of a plein air painting. Suddenly, I remember that I’ve actually been here twice, many years ago, but different parts of this huge place. Maybe one day, I’ll chance upon the exact places that impressed upon me a deeply treasured memory. However, places are more unreliable than humans when it comes to change; I wouldn’t be surprised if I never get the chance to revisit the exact scenes from my memory. <br><br>
    <b>THE NEXT DAY</b>
    <br><br>
    Even after a whole night of being unable to sleep, I still find my way back here. Going early only means more hours of exploration! (in the hottest time of the year..) Who knew that walking for hours on end with no goal in mind, for the sake of the experience, could make my heart feel so full? Ah, but I’m sure you knew that already!<br><br>
    
    I am in a cranky mood, sleep deprived and all puffy, as I breathe in the air imbued with petrichor from the rain that ended just a moment ago, and I feel much better. On the bus ride to the park, I’m ever so slightly excited to see the same things I’ve seen multiple times.. why does it never fail to fulfil me? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRnnhMetvfg&list=RDJRnnhMetvfg&start_radio=1"><u>I don’t need, I don’t eat, I don’t sleep. I’m in love again.</u></a><br><br>
    
    Seeing many people out and about is nice, but the world does seem very beautiful at this time of day - empty except for tourists, the elderly and the unemployed. <br><br>
    
    The swan seemed to recognise this elderly man, whom I think works here, and immediately went up to him to and followed him as he greeted the swan! It was very lovely to watch, I thought to myself, I want to become friends with the swan too… <br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0301 2-min.JPG"><br>
    It slowly made its way over to me, and wagged its tail...<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0307 2-min.JPG"><br>
    Then later, it dipped its head in the water and snorted at me! It didn’t do that to anyone else!!! I couldn’t stop giggling for a while, I didn’t know swans were this adorable and friendly! Now, I have a reason to come back even more frequently. <br><br>
    
    
    It started raining again, and I wandered aimlessly with my umbrella as my only companion. Through the humid rain, my legs ached, but the song of the birds and the sound of the raindrops as they hit the ground helped me carry on. I can’t say that I’ve had other experiences that felt as healing as this. The birds led me to this bench underneath a canopy, overlooking more ponds with lily pads floating.. I sat to recuperate my energy.<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0348_jpg 2-min.JPG"><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0351 2-min.JPG"><br>
    I sat here for a short respite from carrying the umbrella while walking in the rain, and researched swan behaviour until I realised what I think was A BIG ANT CRAWLING ON MY HEAD, which I accidentally flicked onto my phone. My research findings concluded that it was a greeting snort, and left the area with haste! And of course, I decided I will make it my mission to befriend the swan with just my mind and vibes alone (because it’s illegal to feed them.) I also think that there should be more documentation on swan behaviour!<br><br>
    
    
    
    I walked and then found something familiar, an inkling of a memory being rekindled..<br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0384 2-min.JPG"><br>
    
    But just a bit more… and I’ve reached where I was before years ago! The waterfall… with them, with everyone, the photography club I ‘led’ in high school… <br><br>
    
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0397 2-min.JPG"><br>
    I suppressed my emotions to the best of my ability, because the second I entered the cave, some memories from those all years ago came flooding back - although my memory fails me, because I cannot recall every single moment. Still shots from a film that became lost media is the best way I can describe it. We took so many pictures that were lost to time - no, erased - yet it may be that my memories were wiped quicker than the storage memory of the DSLR cameras we used. <br><br>
    
    I have this fear of dropping anything I own in a large body of water - no matter how insignificant the item is, I just don’t want to lose anything to the void forevermore. But this is exactly what the human brain does to us, everyday..  it is so cruel, so grotesque that it disgusts me to even talk about it. <br><br>
    
    The only thing saving us from this cruelty is the longevity of images.. it transfers onto our memories, letting us feel, smell, see, hear… several moments from the past. Between being crippled by fear of the future or mourning the past, I’d choose the latter any day. <br><br>
    
    The only shortcoming of images, is the absence of feelings. If only I could make you feel what I feel..
    <br><br>
    So, I know that if I just had those pictures today, I’d never forget, never... <br><br>
    
    If I had the energy or the stamina, I’m sure I would have accumulated so, so many more memories by now, than what I currently store in my mind. I wonder if I could even make a short film, with my current storage memory. A story… the most important part of a story to me is the finale. The end determines everything.<br><br>
    
    At the end of this trip, I passed the Swan Lake again, saying my goodbyes to the friendly swan. I felt like I was being followed?! <br><br>
    
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjvH6d3WY9Y"><u>A lonely swan</u></a>... I promise, I’ll come see you again. <br><br>
    
    What I feel now… a <i>metamorphosis</i>? Nothing in me has radically changed, but my heart just feels more full, being in this place, writing to no one. I feel at peace. <br><br>
    <img style="width:50%; margin:auto;"src="jul/IMG_0412 2-min.JPG"><br>
    
    The following night, I slept for ages, while dreaming of the.. park? Except what I saw was more like a huge forest. For some reason, I was travelling along a car road, being swallowed by tall pine trees. Passing by many ponds with swans in them. It was a beautiful dream.  <br><br>
    
    I want to make a film.  <br><br> </p>
