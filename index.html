    <!-- ABOUT FILE PATHS:
    - "diary/" is a relative path pointing to the diary folder in the current directory
    - "../" would go up one folder level (parent directory)
    - "/" is the root directory
    - "images/pic.jpg" would look for a file in a subfolder
    - Using /orion/diary assumes that the website is hosted in the orion folder, but it's not! therfore breaking live server and others
